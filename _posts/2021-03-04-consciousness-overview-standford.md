Review of: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's entry on [consciousness](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/). Understanding different concepts of consciousness, and the three problems: what, why, and how.

## Observations

What is the difference between qualitative states of consciousness (qualia) and phenomenal states? Are phenomenal states the whole, comprised out of multiple independent qualia?

Is consciousness a fundamental property of the world, or not?

* Life, for example, is not a fundamental concept. Things can be alive or living, but life itself doesn't exist beyond living things.
* In contrast, electromagnetic fields are fundamental physical phenomena.
* What about consciousness?
  * Does this boil down to the debate over dualism?
  * Our consensus view at the moment - consciousness isn't a fundamental concept, it arises from matter or computation somehow.

Where do we stand on thin vs thick qualia?

* thin - qualia are limited to basic sensory properties.
* thick - sensory qualia also incorporate associations and memories related to what is perceived.
* Our consensus is that the thin view is too limiting, so we align more with thick.

## Conclusions

Couldn't analyse everything in detail - there was too much to cover. But this will serve as a good framework to refer back to for our future readings and help us to have consistent definitions of various terms. There are a multitude of references leading us in different interesting directions.

## Random Musings

Is there a fundamental "experience" associated with viewing colours?

* Does it feel like something to perceive a colour, before associations with that colour are triggered?
* Is there some "base quale" that is always triggered when viewing the same colour? Do the experiences of the sea, the sky, and a blue car have something in common?
* Would two babies viewing colours for the first time have different experiences, if one were viewing blue and the other red, since those colours don't yet mean anything?
* Colour is an interesting case, in which we can easily define all possible colours, but this doesn't really help us define the experiences associated with them?
